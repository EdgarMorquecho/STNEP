# STNEP
Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) using metaheuristics.
STNEP is a full non-convex AC formulation to solve the STNEP problem. It considers in an integrated fashion reactive power expansion, the (N-1) contingency criterion and operational costs. The formulation can be solved by different metaheuristics (IDE-PBILC, DE-PBILC, PSO and TLBO)
